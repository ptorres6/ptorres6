- 👋 Hi, I’m @ptorres6
- 👀 I’m interested in switching careers and learn more about data science. I just completed a 7 week program in data science and policy but due to tumultuous
family life I did not get out as much as I wanted. I figured this would be a great opportunity to continue my studies without the stress of a particular timeline.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R coding!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...i'll let you know!
- 📫 How to reach me ...probably through here?
